## Background

My name is Alexander Unterrainer and I am a financial engineer specialised in KDB/Q development. After graduating from a technical high school for programmers in 2006 (Facebook only started to become popular in Europe and the internet looked very different back then) I decided to not persuade a bachelor degree and applied randomly at job openings. By pure coincidence I ended up working as an assistant portfolio manager in a small, private investment bank in Bolzano (South Tyrol, Italy). I immediately fell in love with the stock market and the financial markets. After 3 years of full-time employment witnessing the financial crisis of 2008 and all it's implications I decided to go back to school and obtain a Bachelor in Ecomincs and Mangement from the Free University of Bolzano. During my second year I came across an article about "The machines are taking over Wall Street" in the Economist and that's when I realised how the field of computational finance and algorithmic trading combines my passion for finance with my passion for technology. After graduating from the Free University of Bolzano I decided to expand my knowledge of computational finance and started a Master in High Frequency Finance and Trading at the University of Essex in Colchester, United Kingdom. I concluded my studies with a Master in Financial Systems Engineeing at the University College of London in 2015.  

## Professional Career

After completing university I started working as a technology analyst for Citigroup in Canary Wharf. I was part of the technology graduate program that lasted 2 years. The graduate program consits of 11 weeks class-room style training followed by two rotations, lasting 9 months each. While the first rotation is assigned randomly and I ended up in a C# team working on asset backed securities, the second rotation is more like an interview process with the teams of interest. I already came across KDB/Q before joining Citigroup, my former flat mate of that time worked with KDB/Q and so he introduced me to this "obscure" language and its strength in the financial industry. After this introduction I was curious and started to read more about KDB/Q starting with the obvious [code.kx.com](https://www.code.kx.com). After reading [Q for Mortals](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/) the natural progression was to join the KDB/Q team at Citigroup for my second rotation. This is where my professional career as KDB/Q developer started. 

Throughout my career I have worked for several investment banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley or UBS and I currently work in the FX KDB team at HSBC. I have worked across different asset classes such as equities and FX and have a good understanding of the different financial products (stocks, currencies) as well as their derivatives (options, futures, forwards, swaps). I have a deep understanding of the tick-architecture and how to store market data, providing advanced APIs and data access to end users such as quants, traders and reserachers.
